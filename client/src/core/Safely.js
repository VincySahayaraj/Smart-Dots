                            Our goal is to completely re-define home security to include the overall well-being of our customers. We started SafelyTeam because we have a very simple belief: Overall well-being does not stop with home security. To achieve this, we have put together a platform that not only focuses on your home security needs but also helps you look after your own, and your family’s, safety and overall wellness.
                            </h4>

                            <p>But it doesn't end there - we went one step further when we created SafelyTeam by making it as simple as possible to set up our system.  Our systems are built using cutting-edge technology and high-quality components, with very secure and powerful software, but that doesn't mean they're complicated for the user.<br/><br/>

                    SafelyTeam is bringing you a platform that provides a comprehensive approach to Security, Safety, and Wellness.</p>

                            <p className="mb-5">SafelyTeam uses state-of-the-art hardware, with utmost importance always given to security. Security is paramount in the IoT world and we understand that. To ensure our customers' security SafelyTeam's hub (also called a Gateway), which is the brain of the system, provides hardware-accelerated encryption. The hardware chip provides encryption and decryption of data through AES-128 or ECC. With hardware-accelerated encryption, loads on the CPU are also reduced, improving the hub's performance. The hub is built with full support for running local applications and services through a powerful onboard processor and an efficient Linux-based platform. Our hub is a Zigbee-based system that is designed to provide a fully functional smart home platform that runs locally on the hub.</p>

                            <p className="mb-3">While most of our competitors are focusing on security and to some extent on safety, we also focus on the overall well-being of our customers. We have made wellness a part of our platform to ensure that along with safety and security, we can also help you take care of your most valued possession - your own and your family's health.  Our AIR QUALITY SENSOR helps measure VOC Levels in your home. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from some solids and liquids. </p>

                            <p className="mb-1">VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have both short and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands, many of which can be found in the average home.<br /><br />

                    It does not end there. We will be constantly working on expanding our wellness solutions in the future and add new solutions and products to our portfolio.</p>

                            <p className="mb-4">SafelyTeam already offers almost everything that competitors are offering, and we plan on adding the other common features in the coming weeks. On top of that, there are many features that SafelyTeam already offers that are not available from other providers, some of whom have been in the market for several years. For example, hardware encryption, or our unique focus on wellness. <br /><br />

                    Moreover, our prices are very hard to beat considering the range of appliances and services we offer. The table below summarizes some of the key points when comparing SafelyTeam with other providers. </p>
                            <h3 className="mb-3 premi">INTEGRATED TEMPERATURE SENSOR</h3>
                            <p className="mb-4">Almost all sensors offered by SafelyTeam also measure temperature and report it in real-time, providing a home-wide view of temperature distribution which can provide useful insights about your home, your heating or cooling systems, and how they could be improved.</p>

                            <p className="mb-4">SafelyTeam's Air Quality Sensor provides a real-time view of the indoor air quality, indicating whether additional ventilation is required in a given area to improve air quality. The sensor measures:</p>

                            <li>VOC Levels (Volatile Organic Compounds that are at high levels of concentration indoors)</li>

                            <p className="mb-4">As well as being emitted from a variety of domestic products, there is evidence that Volatile Organic Compounds are also produced by mould which can have a detrimental impact on both long and short-term health.  Further to that, humidity and temperature combined can have an impact on the day-to-day comfort within your home.  These three measurements give you an excellent overview of the conditions within your environment and allow you an additional level of control over the health and well-being of you and your loved ones. </p>

If you live in Bristol and want installation now, then just send an email to support@safelyteam.com. </p>

With its powerful processor and Linux-based system, the hub is powerful enough to support functions like an NVR (Network Video Recorder) where local IP cameras can be locally integrated into the hub, without any cloud dependency. Hub-based NVR along with local storage of videos will add a new layer of privacy that does not exist in any system today.   </p>

This enables you to create useful experiences through the rule engine, and add value to your lifestyle while contributing towards efficiency and convenience. Our rules will run locally for all devices that are directly integrated with the hub, providing a lightning-fast execution time and avoiding dependency on the cloud. </p>
