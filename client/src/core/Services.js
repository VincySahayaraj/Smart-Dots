                        <p className="textcustom no-plr-0">Our professional installation service ensures that your mower is installed correctly and any unforeseen challenges are addressed before any issues occur. We leverage the wire laying machine designed specifically for robotic mower installations to ensure that the wire is hidden and protected. Whether its just a backyard or a complex installation that includes back and front yard, separated by a fence and driveways, we will ensure that the robotic mower gets every inch of the yard.</p>

                        <p className="textcustom no-plr-0">Just like your car, even the robotic mowers require regular service to ensure optimal performance and smooth operation. SmartDots offers annual maintenance service where tasks such as cleaning the mower, change of weather seal, re-calibration of sensors, checking the battery, firmware upgrades, lubrication of all bearings and a long list of other tasks are performed to ensure the mower is ready for the next mowing season. We also offer optional pick up and drop off service.</p>

                        <p className="textcustom no-plr-0">Our patent pending product dotGate ensures that the mower has the ability to autonomously move between the front and back yards when separated by a fence. An optional battery operated locking kit will soon be available that ensures that the gate remains locked when not required by the mower, preventing pets to get away through the gate. The dotGate was created to keep the robotic mowerâ€™s feature true to its completely automated capability. Without the dotGate, the user will have to move the mower manually between fences, which defeats the purpose of a fully automated robotic lawn mower.</p>

Whether you want to promote your small business locally, add a skin that matches the holiday theme or just protect the mower from scratches, dotWrap is a solution that addresses it all.</p>
