								<span className="testimonials-slide">Thank you very much for helping me with my smart home setup. I wanted to thank you for recommending the water leak sensor for my attic. Soon after the sensor was installed, we had some heavy rains, and the HVAC sensor picked up water leak. I rushed to the attic to find that my roof was leaking. If it was not for the sensor, I would have never known about this leak. My home is newly built and my warranty is about to expire in a couple of months. If it was not for the recommended sensor, then I would not have been able to get this fixed within my warranty. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. All other devices - cameras, door contacts, motion, thermostat, door lock, garage opener etc are also working great and I see a lot of value in having them, now that I am out of town for few weeks. I am also attaching a picture of the leak picked up by the sensor..</span>
